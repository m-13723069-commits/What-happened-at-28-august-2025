I will make a report what has happened today every day
In a deeply unsettling attack, a gunman opened fire during morning Mass at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis on August 27, 2025, resulting in the deaths of two children (ages 8 and 10) and injuries to 17 others, including 14 children and three elderly parishioners. The suspect died by suicide at the scene. Federal authorities are investigating the incident as both domestic terrorism and a hate crime against Catholics .
